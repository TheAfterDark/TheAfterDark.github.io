What you know about rollin' down in the deep? <br>
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze <br>
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah <br>
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy <br>

Falling out, in a drought <br>
No flow, rain wasn't pouring down (pouring down) <br>
See, that pain was all around <br>
See, my mode was kinda lounged <br>
Didn't know which-which way to turn </p>

Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work <br>
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (get it) <br>
Everything that I do is electric <br>

Both hands together, God, let me pray (now let me pray) <br>
Uh, I've been going right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf) <br>
Pass the baton, back to them all <br>
Swimming in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh <br>

My rhyme's inclined to break your spine <br>
They say that I'm so fine <br>
You could never match my grind (true) <br>
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf) <br>
